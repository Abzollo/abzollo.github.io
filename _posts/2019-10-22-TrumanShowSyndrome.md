If you know the movie *The Truman Show*, then you know what I’m talking about, and you’ve seen this *syndrome* before. I’ve personally seen it a lot in my life. Guess where? You guessed right: the land of Hollywood, LA, baby.

Some people act as if they are being constantly filmed by an invisible camera through their whole lives. But unlike Truman, they know they’re being filmed, and -- again -- unlike Truman, the hidden cameras don’t exist. So why did I call it The Truman Show Syndrome? Well, I don’t know, maybe because I like the irony.

In any case, please don’t be like that. People who do that are so self-centered, being around them becomes annoying really quickly. I also feel like these kind of people like to post a lot of selfies on Instagram. In particular, they like to post a sequence of slightly perturbed selfies (for example, one selfie with a smile, one selfie without a smile, and one more selfie with a half-smile and a slightly open mouth). Yes, we get how cool you look, and we did notice that the first selfie is slightly different than the second one, yet they both convey a different level of coolness that we have to be aware of.

It’s not coincidence that this type of behavior is prevalent in Hollywood and its surroundings. Have you noticed that some actors like to act what they want to be? For example, some actors like to act in roles in which they are strong, sexy, beautiful, badass, and heros because they want to be *exactly that*. These actors always act the same roles because they’re not actually acting, they’re just being themselves. They have a cool character in real life, and they just adapt it to new environments with different backstories. They refuse to be in roles in which they are not cool (this is why there are very few uncool Hollywood actors). The biggest example of such an actor is The Rock. He’s a famous actor because he’s The Rock, not because he’s a good actor (which is not bad per se). I don't even remember when he started acting. I used to like The Rock since WWE, and he was my favorite wrestler because I thought he was cool (I still do). Well, I guess some people are just so damn lucky that their personas are so like-able, they can gain money by simply existing.

So how does this relate to *The Truman Show Syndrome*? Well, it's about the very thin line between *acting* and *being*. We act everyday because of social norms and personal goals. It is very natural to behave differently depending on the context. It is as if we are projecting our *selves* on a 3D screen that is life itself. Consider this scenario: what if you wake up tomorrow realizing that you used to be the head of the largest secret criminal organization in the world, and your brain was erased temporarily and timed to retreive its memories on this very day?! You either have to act as before and not change at all, ignoring the **fact** that you are not truly the person you are *acting* like right now, or you have to embrace your true self and *not act*. We all have images of ourselves in our heads, and it feels like this body is only a medium for our minds to act in this world, so we will always **act** what we are and what we want to be. The only difference with actors is that they woke up in a movie ready to embrace their new given selves (i.e. characters).
