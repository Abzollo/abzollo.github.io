JOHN:
(*opens up Snapchat, watches people living their lives*)...

TOM:
(*sighs*).

JOHN:
(*swiping*)...
(*watches a hot snap, smiles faintly*).

TOM:
I don’t understand what’s the joy in watching other people’s lives, having fun and doing stupid shit. People these days are so weird.

JOHN:
I don’t know, it’s kinda fun. Did you see this guy, though? He’s funny. He does stupid shit.

TOM:
No thanks. I think you’re stupid.

JONATHON: (*sits outdoor in his favorite cafe, watches people living their lives*)...

THOMAS: (*sighs*).

JONATHON:
(*screening*)...
(*eyes a mesmerizing lady, coughs gently*). Ahem, **M’lady**. (*tips hat*).

THOMAS: It bewildereth me that a man findth pleasure in the trifling act of observing the commonplace existence of the populace, amusing themselves and whatnot.

JONATHON: ‘Tis the passing of time and merry moments, my friend. Behold this commoner, for he hath wits!

THOMAS: Much obliged, alas methinks thy joyous endeavors is but for the foolish, unscrupulous men.
